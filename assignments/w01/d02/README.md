# Homework!


## Part 1
The homework tonight is to submit your Terminal Output from the CLI homework last night. To do so you will need to:

- Create a new branch for your homework for this week, named `<your_computer_username>-w01d01`. Do so by typing `git checkout -b <your_computer_username>-w01d01`.
- Add the file that you saved your terminal output to into your student directory for the correct week (w01) and day (d02). So the full path should be `/students/<your_first_name>/w01/d02`.
- Add and commit your changes.
- Push the changes to your forked version of the homework repo by typing `git push origin <your_computer_username>-w01d01`. This will create a new branch on your forked repo that mirrors your local branch.
- Create a pull request in the same way described in the homework submission process readme.
